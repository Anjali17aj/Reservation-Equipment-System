# Reservation-Equipment-System
A full stack project associated with TSL.

The Reservation Equipment System (RES) is designed to digitise and streamline the reservation of equipment such as cranes, manlifts, and heavy motor vehicles for Tata Steel Ltd organisation. This web-based application allows users to view equipment availability, make online reservations, and track their status efficiently, replacing manual booking methods. The system features a MongoDB database to manage equipment types, models, and booking details, ensuring data integrity through careful relational structure. Incorporating Node.js, Embedded JS and Express.js, Middlewares RES offers a responsive user interface, including features for booking management and cancellation, aiming to enhance the reservation process with accuracy and user-friendly navigation.
